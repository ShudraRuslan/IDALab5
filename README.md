# IDALab5
In this progect we have a dataset with real transactions and our task is to determine frequent sequences of prodacts and than derive association rules. 
Programm is introduced in file 'main.py'.
At first, we bring the dataset to the required form( to have so-called, normal form). Then we use Apriory algorithm and algorithm of FP-growth 
to determine frequent sequences and association rules.
